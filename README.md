Estimating Variables with Machine Learning models.

In these machine learning projects, my goal was to estimate independent variables as accurately as possible using multiple machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVC) and XGBoost.

I used a dataset for each project, and split the data into a training set and a test set. I trained my model on the training set, and then used the model to predict the values of the independent variables in the test set.

I evaluated the accuracy of my models by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. I found that my models were able to estimate the independent variables with a high degree of accuracy.

The following are some of the specific machine learning models that I used in these projects:

Support vector machines (SVC): SVC is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In these projects, I used SVC for regression tasks.
XGBoost: XGBoost is a gradient boosting framework that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In these projects, I used XGBoost for regression tasks.
I am confident that the skills and knowledge that I gained from these machine learning projects will be valuable in my future endeavors. I am excited to continue learning about machine learning and to apply my skills to new challenges.
